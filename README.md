## 6. Testing

Before testing, make sure that you have everything installed in the `requirements.txt` dependency file. We recommend using `virtualenv` to keep everything clean and isolated.

Some tests require parameters to run. For example, you need API keys for testing certain API's work.

To start a test, run the following:

```
python -m pytest tests/<test_name>.py
```
